# Image_classification_DL

Neural network model prediction to classify Christmas images.

# Dataset

Model is trained on dataset consisting of 8 different classes of christmas images, namely:

- Christmas cookies
- Christmas presents
- Christmas tree
- Fireworks
- Penguin
- Reindeer
- Santa
- Snowman



# How to use?

## step-1

Check the test images from test folder. This folder also has data.py, model_1.py files which can be used to train the model and predict the class of an image after training.

## step-2 

Use any image that is part of above of above mentioned classes to test. Model only takes input extensions of {'png', 'jpeg', 'jpg'}. 

## step-3

Run the test.py file to get the prediction class of test image.
